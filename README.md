This one uses temporal instead of cadence.

Needs Kafka to be running in the background. Kafka needs zookeeper to be running in the background.
Also needs Confluent-local docker image to be running (Confluent makes Kafka work with Go).
Lastly, needs Temporal docker images running (from docker-compose dir: docker-compose up)
